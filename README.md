# Health Scoring Agent

The Health Scoring Agent is a sophisticated, multi-agent system designed to analyze and evaluate code samples for quality, correctness, and adherence to best practices. It uses a combination of rules-based logic and large language models (LLMs) to provide a comprehensive and nuanced assessment of code health.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Multi-Agent Architecture:** The system is built on a modular, multi-agent architecture, where each agent is responsible for a specific aspect of the analysis. This allows for a clear separation of concerns and makes the system easy to extend and maintain.
*   **Two-Step Evaluation Process:** The evaluation process is divided into two steps. The first step performs a detailed analysis of the code, using web grounding to ensure the information is accurate and up-to-date. The second step formats the analysis into a clean, structured JSON object.
*   **Advanced Product Categorization:** The system uses a sophisticated, rules-based product categorization engine with an LLM fallback. This allows for accurate and reliable categorization of code samples, even in ambiguous cases.
*   **Detailed System Instructions:** The LLMs are guided by a detailed set of system instructions that define their persona, workflow, and the criteria for their analysis. This ensures that the analysis is consistent, rigorous, and aligned with the project's goals.
*   **Code Cleaning:** The system includes a utility to remove comments from the code before analysis. This ensures that the analysis is focused on the executable code and is not influenced by comments.
*   **Web Interface:** The project includes a simple web interface for submitting code samples for analysis. The interface provides a user-friendly way to interact with the system and view the results of the analysis.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The Health Scoring Agent is built on a multi-agent architecture that is designed to be modular, extensible, and maintainable. The system is composed of the following key components:

### Orchestrator

The `CodeAnalyzerOrchestrator` is the heart of the system. It is responsible for coordinating the workflow of the various agents and ensuring that the analysis is performed in the correct order. The orchestrator uses a sequential agent to manage the overall flow of the analysis, which is divided into the following three phases:

1.  **Initial Analysis:** In this phase, a parallel agent is used to perform a set of initial analysis tasks, including language detection, region tag extraction, and product categorization.
2.  **Evaluation:** In this phase, a sequential agent is used to perform a two-step evaluation of the code. The first step uses an `InitialAnalysisAgent` to perform a detailed analysis of the code, and the second step uses a `JsonFormattingAgent` to format the analysis into a structured JSON object.
3.  **Result Processing:** In this phase, a `ResultProcessingAgent` is used to process the results of the analysis, enforce the single penalty rule, and format the final output.

### Agents

The system is composed of a variety of agents, each of which is responsible for a specific aspect of the analysis. The agents are organized into the following categories:

*   **Analysis Agents:** These agents are responsible for performing the core analysis of the code. They include agents for analyzing code quality, clarity and readability, runnability, and API effectiveness.
*   **Categorization Agents:** These agents are responsible for categorizing the code sample. They include agents for detecting the language, extracting region tags, and identifying the product.
*   **Formatting Agents:** These agents are responsible for formatting the output of the analysis. They include an agent for converting the raw analysis into a structured JSON object.

### Tools

The agents use a variety of tools to perform their analysis. These tools include:

*   **Code Cleaning:** A utility to remove comments from the code before analysis.
*   **Product Categorization:** A sophisticated, rules-based product categorization engine with an LLM fallback.
*   **Google Search:** A tool to perform web searches to gather information about APIs and best practices.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with the Health Scoring Agent, you will need to have Python 3.12 or higher installed. You will also need to have a Google Cloud project with the Vertex AI API enabled.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/joeshirey/HealthScoringAgent.git
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    GEMINI_PRO_MODEL="gemini-2.5-pro"
    GEMINI_FLASH_LITE_MODEL="gemini-2.5-flash-lite"
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8090
    ```

## ‚ÜîÔ∏è API Reference

The Health Scoring Agent provides a simple REST API for analyzing code samples.

### `POST /analyze`

Analyzes a code sample and returns a detailed analysis of its health.

**Request Body:**

*   `code` (string, required): The code sample to analyze.
*   `github_link` (string, optional): The GitHub link to the code sample.

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:8090/analyze \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "code": "def hello_world():\n    print(\"Hello, world!\")"
}'
```

### `POST /analyze_github_link`

Analyzes a code sample from a GitHub link and returns a detailed analysis of its health.

**Request Body:**

*   `github_link` (string, required): The GitHub link to the code sample.

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:8090/analyze_github_link \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "github_link": "https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-node/blob/main/packages/google-cloud-alloydb/samples/quickstart.js"
}'
```
